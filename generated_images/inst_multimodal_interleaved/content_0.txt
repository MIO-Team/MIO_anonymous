The bright sunlight was getting on my face as I looked out over our neighborhood from my office window. It was just past noon, but it already felt like the perfect time for coffee.  <image_placeholder_0> . The day was calm and quiet so far. The police had called me in to look into what they were calling a case of arson. A fire started by someone outside one of our houses yesterday afternoon.  <image_placeholder_1> . No arrests yet though. There have been no signs that anyone has set anything on fire. We've got security camera footage of the entire event showing absolutely nothing suspicious happening.  <image_placeholder_2> . We haven't seen anything suspicious ourselves either. The first thing we noticed when looking through the tapes is how hot it looks.  <image_placeholder_3> . This area gets very warm in the middle of summer, which may not seem unusual, but with all this recent heat we're wondering if there might be some other reason behind the flames.  <image_placeholder_4> .
